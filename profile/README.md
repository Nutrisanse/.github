# Nutrisense: Smart Solution for Disease Detection and Food/Nutrition Recommendation
<p align="justify">According to the latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO) published in 2022, an estimated 390 million adults worldwide are underweight, and 149 million children under 5 suffer from stunting. Undernutrition remains a leading cause of death in young children, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The consequences of undernutrition are far-reaching, affecting physical and cognitive development, as well as long-term health outcomes. One promising solution to address this growing global issue is the development of a nutrition-focused food recommendation application. This application could be designed to offer tailored meal plans that help individuals, especially those in vulnerable populations, meet their nutritional needs. By providing access to recipes that are nutrient-dense, affordable, and aligned with the dietary preferences of users, the app could empower people to make healthier food choices and improve their overall well-being. Such a platform would play a crucial role in combating undernutrition, reducing the prevalence of stunting, and improving health outcomes globally.</p>


## Themes 
<p align="justify">This project is focused on developing a personalized medical checkup application that provides tailored dietary recommendations based on users' individual health conditions. By collecting and analyzing key health metrics such as height, weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, the app will offer customized food guidance that directly addresses the user’s unique health profile. The main goal of this application is to empower individuals to make informed, health-conscious food choices that align with their specific needs. Through predictive modeling, the app will be able to identify potential health risks and suggest appropriate foods that can mitigate those risks. In addition, the integration of computer vision technology will allow the app to analyze food images, offering users real-time, actionable dietary advice based on the foods they consume.</p>

<p align="justify">The second key component of this project is its focus on disease prevention and promoting overall wellness. By offering a personalized food safety analysis and nutrient-based recommendations, the app aims to proactively manage users' health and prevent chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. With the ability to adapt to changing health metrics, the app will serve as a dynamic tool that evolves with the user’s health status, ensuring that dietary guidance remains relevant and effective over time. Ultimately, this solution will help users not only understand their current health condition but also make proactive, informed decisions about their diet that support long-term well-being.</p>
